console.log('🧪 Testing Bulk Shape Creation Fix');
console.log('==================================');

console.log('\n🔧 Root Cause Analysis:');
console.log('The issue was a race condition in bulk shape creation where:');
console.log('1. Multiple shapes were created rapidly');
console.log('2. Each shape triggered individual database sync operations');
console.log('3. Database operations interfered with each other');
console.log('4. Some shapes were lost during the sync process');

console.log('\n✅ Solutions Implemented:');

console.log('\n1. **Batch Creation Architecture**');
console.log('   - Added `_createShapeData()` method for shape data preparation');
console.log('   - Added `_batchAddShapes()` method for local store operations');
console.log('   - Added `batchCreateShapes()` in canvas.js for atomic database sync');
console.log('   - Added `createShapesBatch()` in useCanvasSync.js for hook integration');

console.log('\n2. **Improved Creation Flow**');
console.log('   - Step 1: Prepare all shape data locally (no database sync)');
console.log('   - Step 2: Add all shapes to local store at once');
console.log('   - Step 3: Sync all shapes to database atomically');
console.log('   - Fallback: Individual creation if batch fails');

console.log('\n3. **Race Condition Prevention**');
console.log('   - Eliminated individual database sync operations during bulk creation');
console.log('   - Used atomic batch writes to prevent interference');
console.log('   - Added proper error handling and fallback mechanisms');
console.log('   - Maintained optimistic UI updates for responsiveness');

console.log('\n4. **Enhanced Validation**');
console.log('   - Added comprehensive logging for debugging');
console.log('   - Added shape count validation at each step');
console.log('   - Added error recovery mechanisms');
console.log('   - Added fallback to individual creation if batch fails');

console.log('\n📋 Test Scenarios:');
const testScenarios = [
  {
    name: 'Small Batch (10 shapes)',
    description: 'Create 10 circles in a grid - should work perfectly',
    expectedResult: 'All 10 shapes created and synced'
  },
  {
    name: 'Medium Batch (50 shapes)',
    description: 'Create 50 rectangles in a grid - should handle efficiently',
    expectedResult: 'All 50 shapes created and synced'
  },
  {
    name: 'Large Batch (100 shapes)',
    description: 'Create 100 circles in a grid - the original failing case',
    expectedResult: 'All 100 shapes created and synced (no lost shapes)'
  },
  {
    name: 'Mixed Shape Types',
    description: 'Create various shape types in bulk',
    expectedResult: 'All shapes created with correct properties'
  },
  {
    name: 'Network Interruption',
    description: 'Test behavior during network issues',
    expectedResult: 'Graceful fallback to individual creation'
  }
];

testScenarios.forEach((scenario, index) => {
  console.log(`\n${index + 1}. ${scenario.name}`);
  console.log(`   ${scenario.description}`);
  console.log(`   Expected: ${scenario.expectedResult}`);
});

console.log('\n🎯 Expected Results:');
console.log('- ✅ No more lost shapes during bulk creation');
console.log('- ✅ Faster bulk creation due to batch operations');
console.log('- ✅ Better error handling and recovery');
console.log('- ✅ Maintained UI responsiveness');
console.log('- ✅ Proper database synchronization');

console.log('\n📝 Manual Testing Instructions:');
console.log('1. Open the canvas application');
console.log('2. Use AI assistant to create 100 circles');
console.log('3. Verify all 100 circles appear on canvas');
console.log('4. Check browser console for batch creation logs');
console.log('5. Refresh page and verify all shapes persist');
console.log('6. Test with different batch sizes (10, 50, 100)');

console.log('\n🔍 Key Log Messages to Look For:');
console.log('- "🔄 Starting batch creation of X shapes..."');
console.log('- "📦 Prepared X shapes for batch creation"');
console.log('- "🔄 Using batch creation for X shapes..."');
console.log('- "✅ Batch creation completed: X shapes synced"');
console.log('- "✅ Batch shapes created and synced to database: X shapes"');

console.log('\n✅ The bulk creation race condition should now be fixed!');
console.log('All shapes should be created and synced properly without any losses.');
