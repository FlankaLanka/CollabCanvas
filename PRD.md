## Data Model

### Firestore Collection: `canvas` (single document for MVP)

**Document ID:** `global-canvas-v1`

```json
{
  "canvasId": "global-canvas-v1",
  "shapes": [
    {
      "id": "shape_uuid_1",
      "type": "rectangle",
      "x": 100,
      "y": 200,
      "width": 150,
      "height": 100,
      "fill": "#cccccc",
      "createdBy": "user_id",
      "createdAt": "timestamp",
      "lastModifiedBy": "user_id",
      "lastModifiedAt": "timestamp",
      "isLocked": false,
      "lockedBy": null
    }
  ],
  "lastUpdated": "timestamp"
}
```

### Firebase Realtime Database: `presence` (for cursors)

```json
{
  "sessions": {
    "global-canvas-v1": {
      "user_id_1": {
        "displayName": "John Doe",
        "cursorColor": "#FF5733",
        "cursorX": 450,
        "cursorY": 300,
        "lastSeen": "timestamp"
      },
      "user_id_2": {
        "displayName": "Jane Smith",
        "cursorColor": "#33C1FF",
        "cursorX": 620,
        "cursorY": 180,
        "lastSeen": "timestamp"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Why Two Databases?**

- Firestore: For persistent canvas state (shapes, metadata)
- Realtime Database: For high-frequency updates (cursor positions, presence)
- Realtime Database has lower latency for cursor movements

---

## Proposed Tech Stack

### Option 1: Firebase (Recommended for Speed)

**Frontend:**

- React + Vite
- Konva.js for canvas rendering
- Tailwind CSS for UI

**Backend:**

- Firebase Authentication
- Firestore for state persistence
- Firebase Realtime Database for cursor positions

**Pros:**

- Fastest setup (authentication is plug-and-play)
- Built-in real-time capabilities
- Generous free tier
- Automatic scaling
- Simple deployment with Firebase Hosting

**Cons:**

- Vendor lock-in to Google
- Firestore queries can be expensive at scale
- Less control over backend logic

**Pitfalls to Watch:**

- Firestore charges per read/write - optimize updates
- Need to structure data carefully (avoid deep nesting)
- Realtime Database better for cursor positions (lower latency)

---

### Option 2: Supabase + WebSockets

**Frontend:**

- React + Vite
- Konva.js for canvas rendering
- Tailwind CSS for UI

**Backend:**

- Supabase Auth
- Supabase PostgreSQL for state persistence
- Supabase Realtime for updates

**Pros:**

- Open source alternative to Firebase
- PostgreSQL is more flexible than Firestore
- Built-in real-time subscriptions
- Better for complex queries later

**Cons:**

- Slightly more setup than Firebase
- Realtime can be tricky with high-frequency updates
- Free tier has connection limits

**Pitfalls to Watch:**

- Realtime subscriptions count against connection limits
- Need to handle reconnection logic carefully
- Cursor updates might need separate WebSocket channel

---

### Option 3: Custom Backend (Express + Socket.io)

**Frontend:**

- React + Vite
- Konva.js for canvas rendering
- Tailwind CSS for UI

**Backend:**

- Node.js + Express
- Socket.io for real-time communication
- MongoDB or PostgreSQL for persistence
- Custom authentication or Auth0

**Pros:**

- Complete control over architecture
- Socket.io is purpose-built for real-time
- Can optimize exactly for your use case
- No vendor lock-in

**Cons:**

- Most time-consuming to build
- Need to build authentication from scratch
- More deployment complexity
- Need to manage scaling yourself

**Pitfalls to Watch:**

- Authentication takes significant time
- Need to handle WebSocket reconnection
- Scaling WebSockets requires sticky sessions
- More potential for bugs in custom code

---

## Recommended Stack for MVP

**Frontend:** React + Vite + Konva.js + Tailwind  
**Backend:** Firebase (Authentication + Firestore + Realtime Database)  
**Deployment:** Firebase Hosting or Vercel

**Rationale:** Given the 24-hour constraint, Firebase provides the fastest path to a working MVP. Authentication is solved, real-time is built-in, and deployment is simple. You can always migrate later if needed.

## Risk Mitigation

**Biggest Risk:** Real-time sync breaking under load  
**Mitigation:** Test with multiple browsers early and often; use Firebase Realtime Database for high-frequency updates

**Second Risk:** Performance degradation with many objects  
**Mitigation:** Use canvas-based rendering (Konva), not DOM elements; limit to 500 shapes for MVP

**Third Risk:** Locking mechanism causing deadlocks  
**Mitigation:** Implement automatic lock timeout (3-5 seconds); clear visual feedback for lock state

**Fourth Risk:** Cursor updates causing performance issues  
**Mitigation:** Use Firebase Realtime Database (not Firestore) for cursor positions; throttle updates to 20-30 FPS
