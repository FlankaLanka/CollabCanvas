console.log('🧪 Testing Batch Deletion Fix');
console.log('============================');

console.log('\n🔧 Root Cause Analysis:');
console.log('The issue was that bulk deletion was slow for remote users because:');
console.log('1. Each shape deletion triggered individual database operations');
console.log('2. Remote users received updates one by one as each shape was deleted');
console.log('3. This created a slow, sequential deletion experience');
console.log('4. Local user saw instant deletion, but remote users saw slow one-by-one removal');

console.log('\n✅ Solutions Implemented:');

console.log('\n1. **Batch Deletion Architecture**');
console.log('   - Added `batchDeleteShapes()` in canvas.js for atomic database operations');
console.log('   - Added `deleteShapesBatch()` in useCanvasSync.js for hook integration');
console.log('   - Added `deleteShapesBatch()` in ModernCanvasContext.jsx for context integration');

console.log('\n2. **Improved Deletion Flow**');
console.log('   - Step 1: Remove all shapes from local store immediately (responsive UI)');
console.log('   - Step 2: Sync all deletions to database atomically (single operation)');
console.log('   - Step 3: Remote users receive single update with all deletions');

console.log('\n3. **Performance Improvements**');
console.log('   - Single database operation instead of multiple individual operations');
console.log('   - Atomic batch write prevents race conditions');
console.log('   - Remote users see instant bulk deletion instead of slow one-by-one');
console.log('   - Maintained optimistic UI updates for local user');

console.log('\n4. **Updated Methods**');
console.log('   - `deleteSelectedShapes()` now uses batch deletion');
console.log('   - `deleteAllShapes()` now uses batch deletion');
console.log('   - Individual `deleteShape()` still works for single deletions');

console.log('\n📋 Test Scenarios:');
const testScenarios = [
  {
    name: 'Small Batch Deletion (10 shapes)',
    description: 'Select and delete 10 shapes - should be instant for all users',
    expectedResult: 'All 10 shapes disappear instantly for remote users'
  },
  {
    name: 'Medium Batch Deletion (50 shapes)',
    description: 'Select and delete 50 shapes - should be fast for all users',
    expectedResult: 'All 50 shapes disappear in single update for remote users'
  },
  {
    name: 'Large Batch Deletion (100 shapes)',
    description: 'Select and delete 100 shapes - the original slow case',
    expectedResult: 'All 100 shapes disappear instantly for remote users'
  },
  {
    name: 'Delete All Shapes',
    description: 'Clear entire canvas with many shapes',
    expectedResult: 'All shapes disappear in single update for remote users'
  },
  {
    name: 'Mixed Selection Deletion',
    description: 'Select various shape types and delete together',
    expectedResult: 'All selected shapes disappear instantly for remote users'
  }
];

testScenarios.forEach((scenario, index) => {
  console.log(`\n${index + 1}. ${scenario.name}`);
  console.log(`   ${scenario.description}`);
  console.log(`   Expected: ${scenario.expectedResult}`);
});

console.log('\n🎯 Expected Results:');
console.log('- ✅ Instant deletion for local user (unchanged)');
console.log('- ✅ Instant bulk deletion for remote users (improved)');
console.log('- ✅ Single database operation instead of multiple');
console.log('- ✅ No more slow one-by-one deletion for remote users');
console.log('- ✅ Better collaborative experience');

console.log('\n📝 Manual Testing Instructions:');
console.log('1. Open the canvas application in two browser windows/tabs');
console.log('2. Create 50-100 shapes in one window');
console.log('3. Select all shapes and delete them');
console.log('4. Observe the other window - shapes should disappear instantly');
console.log('5. Test with different batch sizes (10, 50, 100 shapes)');
console.log('6. Test "Delete All" functionality');

console.log('\n🔍 Key Log Messages to Look For:');
console.log('- "🗑️ Batch deleting X selected shapes..."');
console.log('- "✅ Batch shapes deleted and synced: X shapes"');
console.log('- "✅ Batch shape deletion completed atomically: X shapes deleted"');
console.log('- "✅ Selected shapes batch deleted: X shapes"');

console.log('\n🚀 Performance Comparison:');
console.log('BEFORE (Individual Deletion):');
console.log('- Local user: Instant (optimistic UI)');
console.log('- Remote user: Slow, one-by-one (X database operations)');
console.log('- Database: X separate write operations');
console.log('- Network: X separate update messages');

console.log('\nAFTER (Batch Deletion):');
console.log('- Local user: Instant (optimistic UI)');
console.log('- Remote user: Instant bulk deletion (1 database operation)');
console.log('- Database: 1 atomic batch write operation');
console.log('- Network: 1 update message with all deletions');

console.log('\n✅ The batch deletion should now provide instant bulk deletion for all users!');
console.log('Remote users will see shapes disappear instantly instead of one by one.');
