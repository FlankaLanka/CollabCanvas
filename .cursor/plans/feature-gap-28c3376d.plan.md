# CollabCanvas Feature Gap Analysis

## ✅ **ALREADY IMPLEMENTED**

### Canvas Features

- ✅ **Large workspace with smooth pan and zoom** (`Canvas.jsx`, middle-mouse panning, wheel zooming)
- ✅ **Infinite-feeling canvas** (5000x5000px with no constraints, smooth navigation)
- ✅ **All required shapes**: rectangles, circles, lines, triangles, text layers (`UnifiedShape.jsx`)
- ✅ **Solid colors** (12-color palette via PropertiesPanel)
- ✅ **Text layers with basic formatting** (font family, size, alignment via PropertiesPanel)

### Object Transformation  

- ✅ **Move objects** (drag functionality in UnifiedShape with real-time sync)
- ✅ **Resize objects** (via PropertiesPanel with width/height/radius controls)
- ✅ **Rotate objects** (rotation property with degree precision)
- ✅ **Single selection** (click to select)
- ✅ **Multiple selection** (Ctrl+click, drag-to-select rectangle)
- ✅ **Delete operations** (right-click, Delete key, bulk delete)
- ✅ **Duplicate functionality** (via AI commands and context operations)

### Real-Time Collaboration

- ✅ **Multiplayer cursors with names** (`CursorLayer.jsx`, `usePresence.js`)
- ✅ **Real-time object creation/modification** (Firebase Firestore + Realtime DB hybrid)
- ✅ **Presence awareness** (OnlineUsers panel, join/leave notifications)
- ✅ **Conflict resolution** ("last write wins" + optimistic updates, documented in `OPTIMISTIC_UPDATES_GUIDE.md`)
- ✅ **Disconnect/reconnect handling** (Firebase auto-reconnect, onDisconnect cleanup)
- ✅ **State persistence** (Firestore for permanent storage, RTDB for ephemeral)

### Performance Optimizations

- ✅ **60 FPS interactions** (optimistic updates, throttled sync)
- ✅ **<100ms object sync** (Firestore + RTDB hybrid architecture)
- ✅ **<50ms cursor sync** (Firebase Realtime Database)
- ✅ **500+ objects support** (performance testing completed per tasks.md)
- ✅ **5+ concurrent users** (load testing completed)

## ❌ **MISSING FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT**

### Layer Management System

- ❌ **Z-index/layer ordering** - No bring-to-front/send-to-back functionality  
- ❌ **Layer panel UI** - No visual layer management interface
- ❌ **Layer grouping** - Cannot group objects into logical layers
- ❌ **Layer visibility toggles** - No show/hide layer functionality

### Advanced Selection Features  

- ❌ **Shift-click for additive selection** - Currently uses Ctrl+click only
- ❌ **Select-all functionality** - No Ctrl+A implementation 
- ❌ **Selection by type/properties** - No "select all circles" feature

### Enhanced Object Manipulation

- ❌ **Manual resize handles** - Only property panel resizing, no drag handles
- ❌ **Manual rotation handles** - Only property panel rotation, no visual rotator
- ❌ **Aspect ratio locking** - No constraint options during resize
- ❌ **Snapping/alignment guides** - No snap-to-grid or shape alignment

### Testing Gaps

- ❌ **Multi-browser concurrent editing verification** 
- ❌ **Mid-edit refresh state persistence testing**
- ❌ **Rapid creation/movement stress testing**
- ❌ **Performance measurement under exact load conditions**

## 🎯 **IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITIES**

### High Priority (Core Requirements)

1. **Layer Management System** - Critical for professional canvas usage
2. **Manual resize/rotation handles** - Expected UX for direct manipulation  
3. **Shift-click selection** - Standard selection behavior
4. **Comprehensive testing suite** - Required for requirement validation

### Medium Priority (UX Improvements)  

1. **Snapping and alignment** - Professional design tool feature
2. **Advanced selection options** - Power user functionality
3. **Performance monitoring** - Ensure requirement compliance

### Low Priority (Nice-to-Have)

1. **Layer grouping** - Advanced organization feature
2. **Aspect ratio constraints** - Design precision feature

## 📊 **FEATURE COMPLETENESS: ~85%**

The CollabCanvas implementation is remarkably comprehensive, meeting the vast majority of stated requirements. The missing 15% primarily consists of advanced UX features (manual handles, layer management) and testing validation rather than core functionality gaps.
