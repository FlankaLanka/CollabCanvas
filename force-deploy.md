# Force Vercel Deployment

This file is created to trigger a new Vercel deployment and ensure the latest AI fixes are deployed to production.

## 🚀 **Steps to Force Deployment:**

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard:**
   - Visit https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Find your CollabCanvas project
   - Go to "Deployments" tab

2. **Trigger New Deployment:**
   - Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment
   - Or go to "Settings" → "Git" → "Redeploy"

3. **Alternative: Push Empty Commit:**
   ```bash
   git commit --allow-empty -m "Force Vercel deployment - AI fixes"
   git push origin main
   ```

4. **Check Deployment Status:**
   - Wait for deployment to complete
   - Check the deployment logs for any errors
   - Test the AI endpoint again

## 🔍 **What to Look For:**

After redeployment, the production API should:
- ✅ Use the updated `api/ai-chat.js` with function calling
- ✅ Include the `ai-functions.js` file
- ✅ Use the enhanced system prompt
- ✅ Return function calls instead of text responses

## 🧪 **Test After Deployment:**

Run this command to test:
```bash
node quick-test.js
```

Expected result: `Has function call: true` instead of `false`
