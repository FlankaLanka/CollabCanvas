console.log('\n🔧 Fixes Applied:');
console.log('1. ✅ Added null checks in ShapeTransformer for detached nodes');
console.log('2. ✅ Added cleanup effect to remove invalid transformer nodes');
console.log('3. ✅ Added error boundary to catch and handle React-Konva errors');
console.log('4. ✅ Added stage/parent validation before transform operations');

console.log('\n🎯 Expected Results:');
console.log('- No more "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading \'setAttrs\')" errors');
console.log('- Transformer gracefully handles deleted shapes');
console.log('- Error boundary catches any remaining edge cases');
console.log('- Canvas remains stable during shape deletion');

console.log('\n📝 Manual Testing Instructions:');
console.log('1. Open the canvas application');
console.log('2. Create some shapes (rectangles, circles, etc.)');
console.log('3. Select shapes to see the transformer handles');
console.log('4. Right-click to delete shapes while transformer is active');
console.log('5. Try rapid deletion scenarios');
console.log('6. Check browser console for any remaining errors');

console.log('\n✅ If no errors appear in the console, the fix is working correctly!');
